<h2>2. A Safe Stronghold, Our God is Still</h2>
<p>
A safe stronghold our God is still,<br>
a trusty shield and weapon;<br>
he'll keep us clear from all the ill<br>
that hath us now o'ertaken.<br>
The ancient prince of hell<br>
hath risen with purpose fell;<br>
strong mail of craft and power<br>
he weareth in this hour;<br>
on earth is not his fellow.<br><br>
With force of arms we nothing can,<br>
full soon were we down-ridden;<br>
but for us fights the proper Man<br>
whom God himself hath bidden.<br>
Ask ye, who is this same?<br>
Christ Jesus is his name,<br>
the Lord Sabaoth's Son;<br>
he, and no other one,<br>
shall conquer in the battle.<br><br>
And were this world all devils o'er,<br>
and watching to devour us,<br>
we lay it not to heart so sore;<br>
not they can overpower us.<br>
And let the prince of ill<br>
look grim as e'er he will,<br>
he harms us not a whit;<br>
for why? His doom is writ;<br>
a word shall quickly slay him.<br><br>
God's word, for all their craft and force,<br>
one moment will not linger,<br>
but, spite of hell, shall have its course;<br>
'tis written by his finger.<br>
And though they take our life,<br>
goods, honour, children, wife,<br>
yet is their profit small;<br>
these things shall vanish all:<br>
the city of God remaineth.
