<h2>748. What a wonderful change</h2>
<p>
What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought<br>
Since Jesus came into my heart!<br>
I have light in my soul for which long I have sought,<br>
Since Jesus came into my heart!<br>
<i><br>
Since Jesus came into my heart,<br>
Since Jesus came into my heart,<br>
Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll,<br>
Since Jesus came into my heart.</i><br><br>
2 I have ceased from my wand'ring and going astray,<br>
Since Jesus came into my heart!<br>
And my sins which were many are all washed away,<br>
Since Jesus came into my heart!<br><br>
3 Iâ€™m possessed of a hope that is steadfast and sure,<br>
Since Jesus came into my heart!<br>
And no dark clouds of doubt now my pathway obscure,<br>
Since Jesus came into my heart! <br><br>
4 There's a light in the valley of death now for me,<br>
Since Jesus came into my heart!<br>
And the gates of the City beyond I can see,<br>
Since Jesus came into my heart! <br><br>
5 I shall go there to dwell in that city, I know,<br>
Since Jesus came into my heart!<br>
And I'm happy, so happy, as onward I go,<br>
Since Jesus came into my heart!<br>
</p>
