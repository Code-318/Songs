<h2>JP.94 If I were a Butterfly</h2>
<p>
If I were a butterfly 
I thank you Lord for giving me wings.
If I were a robin in a tree
I thank you Lord that I could sing.
If I were a fish in the sea
I’d wiggle my tail and giggle with glee.
But I just thank you Father for making me, me.
<i>
For you gave me a heart and you gave me a smile, 
you gave us Jesus and you made me your child, 
and I just thank you Father for making me, me.
</i>
If I were an elephant
I thank you Lord by raising my trunk.
If I were a kangaroo 
You know I’d hop right up to you.
If I were an octopus
I’d thank you Lord for my fine looks,
But I just thank you Father for making me, me.

If I were a wiggly worm
I thank you Lord that I could squirm.
If I were a fuzzy wuzzy bear
I thank you Lord for my fuzzy wuzzy hair.
If I were a crocodile
I thank you Lord for my great smile
But I just thank you Father for making me, me.
</p>
